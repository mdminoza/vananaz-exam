React Native - Login Form


# Used Libraries
- Foect - Its simple and not too complex when it comes to validation thats why I use this one.
- Prop-types - Helps me define types easily and which props are required, I can easily open up a component and check which props are required and what type they should be.


# Styling
- Extended StyleSheets for React Native  
  - I use this on styling because Global variables are passed to EStyleSheet.build() and available in all stylesheets which for me a bit easy to maintain your style since Im still new with react.
-React Native Paper
  - I also use this React Native Paper but for checkboxes only. It takes time for me on how to make colored boxes so this is one of my my options.
  
# Linting
- ESlint
- Babel-eslint
- Prettier-lint
